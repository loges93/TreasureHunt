Focusing on developing algorithms, writing code, and building systems capable of efficient task performance, computer scientists use technology to address challenging challenges. This work is vital as it drives everything from simple applications to sophisticated artificial intelligence systems, therefore influencing many sectors and enhancing quality of living. When tackling a topic, I start by dissecting it into smaller pieces and then design a logical algorithm or strategy to address each component. I create and test programs to apply these fixes, honing them till they run flawlessly.

Ensuring that the software is dependable, safe, and respects user privacy counts ethically toward the end user and the company. Furthermore crucial is avoiding the development of biased or destructive systems and open communication on the operation of technology.

I was provided the fundamental framework of the code handling several facets of training a model on the Q-training project. I developed the code to run the training loop covering agent learning from experience, knowledge updating over time, and decision making. This included programming the agent's logic for exploration and exploitation to guarantee it could learn to negotiate the maze efficiently.
